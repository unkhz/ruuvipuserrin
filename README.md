# Ruuvipuserrin

This is a rebuild of @unkhz/ruuvitaulu, attempting to improve fault tolerance

- separate measurement delegation functionality (gateway) from parsing the data, so that there can be multiple redundant gateway boxes connected to single parser pipeline
- avoid storing measurements in the gateway after they have been succesfully passed on, so that gateway boxes do not run out of space
