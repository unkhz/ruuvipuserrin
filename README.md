# Ruuvipuserrin

This is a rebuild of @unkhz/ruuvitaulu, attempting to improve fault tolerance

- separate measurement delegation functionality (gateway) from parsing the data, so that there can be multiple redundant gateway boxes connected to single parser pipeline
- avoid storing measurements in the gateway after they have been succesfully passed on, so that gateway boxes do not run out of space

### Install

Ensure you have installed following tools in your gateway box (e.g. raspberry pi).

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
